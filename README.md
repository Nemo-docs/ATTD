git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-directory>
```

- Frontend (local development):

```bash

This starts the Next.js frontend in development mode. The frontend expects the backend base URL to be set via the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL`.

```bash
cd backend
# ensure dependencies are installed (e.g. via pip or your preferred tool)
# then run the FastAPI application
